To hand in your solution, generate a file called `results.csv` with the following header with example results:

```
fname,label
540df1a2ade18e78c546dd43a3b878ff.png,Water
7c8de0e11d33efe68ee397f914e633a8.gif,Poison
df5b9a30e9a690d4fb6722a63f551e4d.jpg,Water
```

The order of files is irrelevant. Send your solutions via MS Teams. Your results should show lower (scroll down for the latest results). Generating results might take a few minutes, so please be patient.
