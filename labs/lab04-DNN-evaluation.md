### Binary problem

#### ROC curve

## Validation methods
* __Training Dataset:__ The sample of data used to fit the model.
* __Validation Dataset:__ The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.
* __Test Dataset:__ The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset. [1]
