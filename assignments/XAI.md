# Project  assignment - Explainable Artificial Intelligence

With the availability of large databases and recent improvements in deep learning methodology, the
performance of AI systems is reaching, or even exceeding, the human level on an increasing number of complex
tasks. Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification, sentiment
analysis, speech understanding or strategic game playing. However, because of their nested non-linear
structure, these highly successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually applied in a
black-box manner, i.e. no information is provided about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions.
Since this lack of transparency can be a major drawback, e.g. in medical applications, the development of
methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing
attention.

## Research goal and expected output

* The aim of the assignment is to make a research and understand terms and issues associated with XAI.
* The aim of the assignment is to create a scientific overview of the various techniques used in XAI.
* Selecting and experimenting with at least one XAI technique is also goal of the assignment. 

## Expected output

 - Overview of the various techniques used in XAI.
 - Experiments with a specific technique, results and conclusions (<b> DO NOT COPY GITHUB CODE SAMPLES INTO ASSIGNMENT! EXTEND EXISTING SOLUTIONS AND USE ANOTHER DATASETS! </b>)

## Milestones

3. week - understanding XAI issues ( Reading research papers, code samples )
