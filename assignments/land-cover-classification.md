# Team project assignment - Land cover classification with Deep Learning using Sentinal-2 multispectral data

## Research goal and expected output

* The goal of this assignment is to use multi-spectral satellite data from Sentinal-2 to create a classification model to detect 9 or 10 land use classes (pasture, anual crop, residential etc.) and test it on Slovakia land data.
* The advantage of using Sentinal-2 data is that it has a high revisit time (5 days) and is free available.
* This model has pottential to be used in many tasks (to monitor forest logging etc.)

* Expected output

 - trained classification model using Keras and Python
 - find a way to access Slovakia land data
 - environmnent to predict land use of Slovakia every 5 days


## Milestones

3. week - dataset exploration and net design
4. week - dataset preparation and first working implementation of the CNN
5. week - training net
6. week - evaluating models
7. week - preparing data for predicting (access Slovakia land data)
8. week - generate label map of the area
