# Team project assignment - Deep reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an emerging trend in the recent years. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on large datasets available in advance. Therefore, for this assignment you will develop a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm able to play a board game. 

## Research goal and expected output

The goal of this assignment is to create a playable board game (available through a web interface or desktop client), where the player is able to compete against an AI (DRL algorithm). The actual game will be decided at the first consultation. In earlier stages, you should use different algorithms and after an evaluation by the consultant focus on improving the best-performing model. The expected output and documentation should contain following:

1. description of the problem and chosen game
2. description of the neural network architecture
3. description of the training process
4. playable game against the AI
5. academic paper with a literature review, methodology and results to be published in the university's journal or a journal with better rating



## Milestones

1. theoretical overview of deep reinforcement learning
2. algorithm and architecture proposal
3. working demo
4. overview paper in LaTeX
5. working model

## Literature
